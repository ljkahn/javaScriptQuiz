creating a javascript quiz

after getting HTML and css remotely set up??

-- what is the first thing that needs to be accomplished

organize HTML with sections for each part of the quiz
1. start button and home page 
2. questions
3. results and score page

need to create a title page with headers and a button that links to the questions


create variables for the important parts of the quiz

quizData --> an array that stores the quiz questions, choices, and correct answers
currentQuestion --> variable used to track the current question being displayed
score --> a variable to store the user's score


what exactly are the objects inside of my array quizData???

questions --> the question text itself
choices --> array of multiple choice 
correct?? --> true or false (BOOLEAN)

FIRST QUESTIONS -->
need to assign the question a list of choices
need to have the answers be clickable
